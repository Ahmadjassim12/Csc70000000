THE DATASET
We had an ideal dataset for this task on Kaggle. For the task of Sales and Profit Analysis, we need to have a dataset with time-period data, sales data, product data, pricing data, customer data, etc.
The provided code below is using the pandas library to read data from a CSV (Comma-Separated
'alues) file named "StoreSaleData.csv." The pd.read_csv function is employed for this purpose, and the resulting DataFrame is stored in the variable named data.
